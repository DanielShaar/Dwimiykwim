Things to worry about later:

If a function uses the same predicate for argument matching on two of its
arguments, throw an ambiguity error.

Do more checks on lambda expressions to determine for sure whether they are
madlabs or lambdas with a typo. Right now we assume madlab if all of the
arguments are pairs, which should maybe be stronger (e.g. all of the cars are
variables).
